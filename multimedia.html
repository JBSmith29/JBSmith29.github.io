<h2> Build your own rifle! </h2>

<p> For a new gun owner, this has several advantages. The most important part of owning your firearm is the ability to familiarize yourself with it to a greater extent. Having a full understanding of how your weapon is put together and how all the parts work is vital when using and operating your gun. This is important for first-time gun owners since they may not have as much knowledge and experience. Building from the ground up gives you a head start on exactly how a gun works which is one of the first steps in gun safety. </p>
