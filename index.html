        <p> This is my index.html page. I plan to build my site to specification laid out in the assignment overview. Learning various tips and tricks throughout the semesters and other learning materials to make the best site I can make. There will be a lot of re-designs and going back through previous versions to update them with new or updated processes that have been learned through out the course. I am looking forward to learning the ins and outs of the web programming and try to utilize them in my current and future job roles.
