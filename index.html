<h2>About Me</h2>

<strong> Hello and Welcome! </strong> 
</p>
<p>
My name is Jacob Smith and I am 29 years old and live in Andover Kansas. I am currently a full time student as well as a full time Systems Engineer for Amazon. 
</p>
<p>
I am trying to get my bachlors in Information System Management as well as Computer Programming Technology. Currently I am slated to graduate in May of 2021 right before my birthday. I am hoping that I can continue in the IT field with my newly learned skills.
</p>
<p>
I have lived in Kansas my whole life with my large family. I have three brothers and three sisters, so family dinners are rather noisey. I live with my girlfriend and our two dogs. Between work, school, and home life there does not seem to be enough time in the day to get everything accomplished that I would like. But I am able to enjoy my hobbies which include sports, video games, and anime. I am very competative so sports and video games are right up my alley. I play flag football, frisbee, golf, basketball, baseball, and pretty much anything else you can think of. I also like to play PC games such as Apex, EFT, and Fall Guys. I also like to watch Anime with my friends, my favorite so far is My Hero Achedemia but I will try to watch anything we put on.
